This project implements attacks on actual cryptography, including:
 * cracking **AES encrypted messages** exploiting algorithm usage pitfalls
 * cloning Pseudo Random Number Generators to **predict random numbers**
 * breaking unsafe message signature and **sign malicious messages**
 * setting up **timing attacks**
 * and much much more**...**

Along with the challenges answers you will find rough implementation
of algorithms used in cryptography like SHA1, MD4, MT19937...

## How to use it?
Use ```ruby >= 2.2```,
install the dependencies with ```bundle install``` and run it:
```bundle exec run.rb```

Usage:

```
run.rb [--help] [--slow] [SET_NUMBER]
  SET_NUMBER  : the number of the test to run, from 1 to 6
  --slow      : run slow tests, may take hours
  --help      : show help message
```

Examples:
```bash
bundle exec run.rb          # run all tests, except the slow ones
bundle exec run.rb --slow 2 # run all Set#2 tests including the slow ones
```

Go to http://cryptopals.com to view the tests,
read the code to understand the answers.
